# Object Oriented Programming:
## 1. Introduction:
Data representation in programming should have - correctness, maintainability, reusability, openness and interoprability, portability, security, integrity and user friendliness.

Softwares have evolved from - Machine Language (01), Assembly Language (CPU instructions MOV - move instruction, LSR - logical shift right, ROR - rotate right), Procedure orientate (C - function based), Object oriented.

In procedure orientated langage:
1) Emphasis is on doing things (algorithms)
2) Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
3) Most of the function share global data.
4) Data move openly around the system from function to function.
5) Function transform data from one form to another.
6) Employs top-down approach in program design.
   
However, in Object Oriented language:
1) Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.
2) Programs are divided into what known as objects.
3) Data structure is designed such as they categorize the objects.
4) Functions that operate on data of an object are tied together in the data structure.
5) Data is hidden and cannot be accessed from external source.
6) Object may communicate with each other through functions.
7) New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary
8) Employs bottom-up approach in program design.

bottom up means we analyze objects which are entities (lower part) then that performs task assosiated linked in object class. In top down it's a simple function performing lineraly.

Basic concepts of OOPS- Objects, Classes, Data abstraction (abstracting or summarising data which are required only) and encapsulation (setting getter and setter for private variables providing data protection - encapsulation from outside), Inheritence (using members from some other parent class), Polymorphism (ability to display in more than one form like function, operator overloading or function overriding - overriding is using function from parent class), Dynamic binding (It is also known as late binding it basically binds data or object with methods or implementation defined in it), Message passing
